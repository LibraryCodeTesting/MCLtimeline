        <p>With strong support from the <i>County Board of Agriculture</i>, the <i>Grange</i>, and the County Agent, the Monmouth County Library system is established by the County Board of Freeholders after a majority of residents vote in favor of starting the organization.</p>
        <p>To help create the library system, the <i>Monmouth County Library Commission</i> appoints Elinor E. Randall as the first County Librarian. Randall’s job begins on May 1st.</p>
        <p>It is also reported that that the library is expected to be fully functioning on September 1st.</p>

        <p>Station libraries are now being established with the goal of making books more easily available to local residents than if they had a city library system. The stations are a mix of local places - public or private - which will house circulating collections for the public to use.</p>
        <p>While the County Library Commission explores the area to find locations for library stations, the first stations are established at Holmdel, Rumson, and at the Woman’s Club in Ocean Grove.</p>
        <p>Every other month, each station will be visited by the county's <i>book automobile</i> and will receive different books to circulate. The library's automobile can hold 800 books, and also has space for boxes of phonograph records and pictures. It was made from a refurbished truck and weighs more than 1 ton.</p>
        <p>Outside of book stations, residents can also borrow items by writing to the Librarian’s Office at the Courthouse in Freehold.</p>

    <li class="twentiesDates">
      <h3 class="twentiesYear">1924 - December 4</h3>
    <p>Bertram Borden, Chairman of the Housing Committee for the Monmouth County Library, requests that the county review options for making additional space for the library's headquarters.</p>
    <p>Just one month after fully opening, Bertram says the library has, “completely outgrown its quarters in the basement of the courthouse.”</p>

        <p><i>There are now 23,875 books in Monmouth County Library's</i> book collection, and they are accessible to the public at 40 library stations.</p>
          <p>A professional relationship has also been established with local schools. <i>Monmouth County Library</i> now provides additional children’s books directly to schools, as well as suppletory reference materials for teachers to use.</p>
          <p>The partnership with schools began after a survey was sent to every school in the county. 41 of the county's schools answered, and the Library Commission visited 26 schools in-person. Out of the 26 schools that were visited, 11 are selected to house circulating children’s collections.</p>

          <p>In one month alone, 2,000 books were distributed to the public via library stations

        <p><i>Monmouth County Library's</i> Headquarters Branch in Freehold has now been expanded into a remodeled boiler room behind the courthouse</p>
        <p>At this time, the library is supported by a tax of 0.2 mill, which comes from the towns who voted to join into the county library system. The tax provided $20,770 to the library for work functions, and another $1,280 is also provided by the state, to help the library serve local schools.</p>
        <p>The county library system now serves 50 schools regularly. Students and teachers can request items for recreational use or classroom instruction. The items are then delivered to to schools via the <i>book automobile</i>.</p>
        <p>There are now 116 distribution stations, and the <i>book automobile</i> visits each one every 2 months.</p>
        <p>The largest book stations are housed at Allentown, Atlantic Highlands, Brielle, Farmingdale, Keansburg, Ocean Grove, and Red Bank.</p>
        <p>Library stations that housed over 500 books could be found in Adelphia, Allenhurst, Clarksburg, Deal, Holmel, Interlaken, Jerseyville, Millhurst, Perrineville, Seabright, Shrewbury, Wayside, West Belmar, and West Farms. </p>
        <p>Library stations that housed over 400 books could be found in Ardens, Colt’s Neck, Eatontown, Highlands, Marlboro, Monmouth Beach, Oakhurst, West Long Branch</p>
        <p>The library states that its goal for 1927 is to increase demand for the library stations.</p>
        <p>There are now 36,557 books in the collection, and 3,738 of the new books resulted directly from patron requests.</p> 
        <p>County librarians say that patrons often request for materials that help improve work skills among manual laborers – such as metal workers, plumbers, and carpenters.</p>
        <p>The library system also has 11,170 registered patrons now, and borrowers report that they do not only borrow items for themselves, but also borrow items for their family members and neighbors as well.</p>  
        <p>Books can be borrowed as long as needed to finish them, and the time can be extended when they are used for studies, or if someone lives far from a distribution center.</p>

        <p>The book collection has circulated 41,268 times in the last year – which was an increase of 10,000 more books compared to the year before that.</p>
        <p>To meet the increased demand, the number of library staff also grows, and some locations now shift from volunteer-run staffing to paid staffing – such as at the Keansburg location.</p>
        <p>The books housed at each book station are tailored to fit each community’s preferences and needs – which are relayed to the county library by those overseeing each station.</p>
        <p>The Headquarters Branch in Freehold is also sreporting that the current location is becoming too crowded again.</p>

      <p>There are now 135 library stations: 12 in stores, 24 in homes – mostly in farmers’ homes, 5 in library buildings, 3 in post offices, 8 in borough halls, 1 in a chapel, 1 at a road station, 1 in a parish house, 1 in a women’s clubhouse, 2 in a Young Men’s Christian Association building, 5 in grange halls, 2 in community centers, 2 in churches, 1 in a summer camp, 1 in a firehouse, 2 in high school libraries, 18 in schools that circulate to adults as well as children, and 46 in schools that only serve children. Each station houses between 50 to 1,000 books.</p>
        <p>Schools are now using 5,517 of <i>Monmouth County Library's</i> reference books, and the <i>book automobile</i> currently has 25 routes that must each be served once every two months. Each route has between two to six stations.</p>
        <p>The county library also reports using the following tactics to acquaint people with the system’s services:</p>
        <p>The librarian joined the grange to have direct contact with farmers and learn their needs.</p>
        <p>The Librarian gave lectures at meetings with the Grange, the Young Men’s Christian Association, Women’s Clubs, at schools, and other organizations.</p>
        <p>Newspapers give articles on library access and new or specialized books.</p>
        <p>The book automobile was made with distinct marketing to make it easily recognizable.</p>
        <p>Library exhibits are made especially for the 5-day county farm bureau meeting, which includes books on agriculture, books for farm women and farm children, map showing library station locations, useful charts, and more.</p>
        <p>“Effective use is made of the library camera.”</p>
        <p>Cooperation is maintained with other agencies, such as the County Health Office, Parent-Teacher Associations, the Boy Scouts of America, the Young Men’s Christian Association, the County Board of Agriculture, the County Social Service Organization, School Boards, Women’s Clubs, Mission-Study Classes, the Grange, the Farm Bureau, Churches, and Schools.</p>
        <p>Examples of helping:</p>
        <p>A farmer requested a trade book that wasn’t in the library. The library requested it from 6 other libraries, the State Library, and the Publisher without success. Then, the Secretary of the State Library Commission borrowed a private copy for the farmer.</p>
        <p>A farm boy with little chance for schooling borrowed a book on stationary engineering. After studying it all winter, they passed an exam to become a stationary engineer and secured a good position of employment.</p>
        <p>A sheep herder borrowed a book on animal diseases which his sheep became sick and he saved his herd – while other flocks perishes.</p>
        <p>When the local potato crop failed and diversification became necessary, the library was ready with truck-garden, fruit, dairy, and poultry books.</p>

        <p>The custodians of the Monmouth County Library system meet in Red Bank Library and form the “Monmouth County Library Round Table”. Henry S. White, President of Red Bank Public Library, is voted to be the Board President, and meetings will occur in the spring and fall. The next meeting will be in May at the home of Mrs. B. D. Yard in Allentown.</p>
        <p>At the first meeting, every participant reported increased circulation numbers. This is partly due to the number of people who are now unemployed and are taking advantage of improving their leisure time.</p>
        <p>The largest problem among the libraries now is the lack of new books due dwindling funds. The library’s funding, which usually comes from taxes, is now unavailable due to so many being unemployed and living in financial strain. Round Table participants are asked to let the public know of the situation.</p>

      <p>Monmouth County’s newer book trailer celebrates its 3rd birthday.</p>
        <p>The trailer’s services are described as being as reliable as the USPS, since it operates in all weather conditions except when so much snow falls that excavation is impossible.</p>
        <p>Its circulation numbers doubled between 1939 and 1940 - entirely through word-of-mouth recommendations, and it still brings materials to out-of-reach communities – such as Vanderburg, Holmeson, Oak Glen, and El. The trailer travels along 10 routes on a bi-weekly schedule.</p>
        <p>Inside, there is a a desk, chairs, racks, and lights. Patrons can choose among 800 titles, and fans are installed in the summertime, then a small coal stove heats the trailer’s inside during the winter.</p>
        <p>Items from the book trailer are fine-free when overdue, since borrowers could easily miss when the book trailer visits again, and the aim of the county is to encourage use of its facilities within reason rather than discourage the borrowing of books.</p>

        <p>Areas that joined the Monmouth County Library system now pay a library tax that comes out to 3/10ths of a mill on the assessed valuation of a property.</p>
        <p>A property assessed at $1,500 - which was the average valuation of a property in Monmouth County at this time, would lead to a tax of 45 cents.</p>
        <p>The commission now seeks to raise the library tax to 4/10ths of a mill, to expand and improve the library’s services. This would mean that the same property owner would now pay 60 cents per year.</p>
        <p>There has been a 16% increase in the area’s population since 1940, and the additional funds would enable evening hours in rural areas, and a new and more reliable “bookmobile” can be purchased for $6,800. Currently, the bookmobile makes weekly deliveries to 64 municipalities, and 60 schools, as well as 45 trailer stops. It also regularly visits the Marlboro state hospital, the county welfare house in Freehold, and Fitkin hospital.</p>

        <p>While many say libraries aren’t worth the investment with cars and TVs today, Miss Julia H. Killian – MCL Director – says reading interest increases. Whenever a book is reviewed on TV, people want the book and the library is swamped with requests for it.</p>
        <p>All libraries agree they need more money. State Library Association will recommend in the fall that $2.50 per person a year should be spent on books – more than twice of what Ocean County gives, and three times more than what MCL donates to its library.</p>
        <p>An increase in tax going to the libraries will need to be where this comes from, or it will have to come from the state.</p>
        <p>The money would be needed for all central headquarters operations and more field workers.</p>
        <p>The State Library Development Committee has recommended that state aid be used. State money should be used for integrating, but not controlling local library purchases and cataloging.</p>
        <p>The report says county librarians also ought to have working agreements with all city libraries, and city libraries ought to coordinate in several ways:</p>
        <p>Have central buildings for combining collections.
Pooling orders for book to avoid duplication.
Operating one catalog department.
Sharing specialized personnel.
Coordinating public, school, and college libraries. 
</p>
        <p>The Library Extension Committee feels that the library should be seen like a lifetime school curriculum. There should be mutual understanding and cooperation between libraries and schools.</p>
        <p>The following concepts should be emphasized:</p>
        <p>Helping children achieve developmental tasks appropriate for each age level and provide for the wide range of different students in a given class.
Using text books for reference and the library for supplemental information.
</p>
        <p>This can be accomplished by providing a library coordinator who helps libraries work these out themselves, but the ultimate problem is to get school libraries to provide reference and text books and the public library to give supplementary cultural reading without unnecessary duplication. 
It would be costly, but worthwhile.</p>

        <p>What’s wrong with the libraries?
First, funds. The structure of the state system is weak and confusing, and the independence of local libraries is a cause and result of this. For example, Beach Haven decided it will no longer service the rest of Long Beach Island – so the county will have to do it. So another library will be needed, or more bookmobile services. Another instance of duplicating books and using more money to produce the same amount of service or – what really happens – having less service provided.
</p>
        <p>There aren’t enough qualified librarians and not enough incentive (money) for students to study librarianship.</p>
        <p>There’s too many small libraries and they can’t get the needed discounts, they duplicate catalogs of books, they can't make full use of the money they have, and can’t provide the minimum number of books needed. In summary: as individual units, they can’t have the money and resources to build an adequate library.</p>
        <p>Children do better, since they have school libraries.</p>
        <p>Another weakness is the lack of cooperation between schools and libraries. College libraries have great reference material that could be used if an agreement existed between Universities and Public Libraries. Public libraries aren’t able to select books with an eye toward providing supplementary reading to school libraries. There is rarely anyone with authority to provide a basic policy for selecting books for all libraries in an area.</p>
        <p>The State Library Development Committee said every individual should be entitled to the following:</p>
        <p>A library or bookmobile stop near their home or near a shopping center, supervised by a professional librarian
A central library, 30 minutes from a home, with 25,000 well-selected, up-to-date titles organized in a working collection – along with magazines, films, recordings, an extensive collection of reference sources, a comfortable reading room, and a staff that includes a children’s specialist.
A program of activities and special services for adults and children – which is non-existent even at the county level. 
A plan where resources from research libraries and state universities can be made public.
</p>
        <p>One other problem that has no final solution or report: the selection of books.</p>
        <p>Librarian select at the county by reading book reviews, answering public demand, and meeting Library Association standards. But there’s much room for error, the budget is limited, and libraries never have enough best sellers to meet the demand.</p>
        <p>For example, two authors may be highly popular, but one author happens to be on the best sellers list so it is ordered by all libraries, while the second author is left out.</p>
        <p>The question is whether libraries should reflect the level of American culture or raise the level. Unfortunately, budgets will probably determine this answer.</p>

        <p>Monmouth County residents pay half a cent per year for every $1,000 assessed on someone’s property. This is $156,000 each year, to pay for facility maintenance, bookmobiles, sublibraries, salaries, and $18,000 goes to books. The ultimate way you judge a library is by tis books, and in Monmouth County each person pays 6 cents a year for books – the third lowest rate in the state.</p>
        <p>MCL receives 70 cents per person, which is the 13th highest in the state. The State Library Association will recommend 2.50 per person, as a minimum for adequate services. Out of the 70 cents given, less than half goes to paying salaries – making the county 16th in the state.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Ocean County gets $62,000 each year, an average of $1.60 per person. 23.5 cents goes for books. Only Sussex County has a higher rate: 24 cents, and 60% goes to librarian salaries.</p>
        <p>Ocean county residents pay nearly 4x more for books and 2x more for salaries compared to Monmouth county.</p>
        <p>Librarians learned that $1.50 is the minimum needed for a run-of-the-mill library. 2 million people in the 13 counties get lower than $1 per capita service – including Monmouth county residents.</p>
        <p>Monmouth circulates 3 books each year for every 2 residents. Ocean circulates more than 5 books for every 2 people. Figuring costs by circulations show that Monmouth residents pay 50 cents each book, while Ocean County residents pay 40 cents each.</p>
        <p>Ocean county’s 2 bookmobiles circulate 32,000 books each year, and 25,000 of them circulate in the summer – when bookmobiles make special runs to the shore. Total circulation in 1954 was 87,000.</p>
        <p>In Monmouth County Library, the bookmobiles delivered 57,000 books each year and the overall circulation in 1954 was 132,000.</p>
        <p>These numbers don’t include how many times people read, because the books also often go to places such as public schools or other public libraries, where they may be read 15 times or more.</p>
        <p>MCL does more business from mail deliveries – 9,000 compared with 376 in Ocean County. Ocean county says it answered 22,000 reference questions, and MCL says 4,000  registrants exist, which is 4x more than ocean.</p>

        <p>One of the biggest challenges for libraries across the state now is staff shortages.</p>
        <p>According to findings from the <i>Commission to Study Library Services in New Jersey</i>, 419 of the state's 567 municipalities offered low compensation to recent graduates in the field. The average salary at this time is $2,500 per year, with little chance for raises in the first few years of working.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the budgets given to libraries now are often too small to do more than a selective refreshment of certain parts of a collection, and librarians are often inheriting older buildings that are too small to maintain the books and equipment that should be included in a modern library.</p>

        <p>Monmouth County Library now delivers books to 5 schools twice a semester, to service 30,000 students and their teachers.</p>
        <p>The <i>American Library Association</i> at this time says that adequate services by a county library should give 5 books to every child that is attending school. Accomplishing this would require each person to pay $1.50. However, Monmouth County residents pay less than $1 per family.</p>
        <p>After tax money is used to pay for salaries, book purchases, maintenance, and upkeep for 2 bookmobiles that visit more than 80 rural stations and branch libraries in municipalities that have little or no local library services, the resulting $66,700 for books does not provide more than 1.5 books per child. As a result, only a total of 25 can be checked out by a given class when in 3rd grade or less.</p>

        <p>Rowland C. Mauch begins a one-person campaign to make a new library building for the Neptune Branch.</p>
        <p>The Neptune library is currently in the Municipal Building on Main Street, and has been part of the Monmouth County Library system since 1931. Mauch now believes it is time for the growing township to have a full library.</p>
        <p>The county library currently change's Neptune's 300-book collection every 3 months. However, if another branch requests one of the books, then Mauch must wrap the book up and mail it to Freehold. Because of this, the most popular books do not at the Neptune Branch very long.</p>
        <p>Mauch is on a speaking campaign to win interest in moving the library, and to find book donations. She has spoken to Parent-Teacher Associations, and is now in service clubs and other civic groups to find support. Mauch also wants to establish memorials within books to earn financial donations, and tells the <i>Asbury Park Press</i> that residents must want a library, and do their part to get it.</p>
        <p>The Township Committee states that they are waiting to see how the current library grows and to see the final demand for books before they give Mauch their support. The Committee does not want to go overboard, but says they will do what they can to give more financial support for what is most needed.</p>

        <p>Monmouth County Library Director, Julia Killian, says the cost of books has risen 75% in the past 25 years.</p>
        <p> Monmouth County Library is the largest library purchasing books in the county, however there still isn't enough funding to comfortably keep the collections modernized while paying for the library to functions - salaries, buildings, maintenance, the book mobiles, supplied, repairs, and more.</p>
        <p>Asbury Park has a permanent population of 18,000 and a summer population of 100,000. Shore towns like this are not only a popular summer resort, but also derive a good deal of income from summer visitors. However, local library cannot meet the needs of its permanent residents, much less the needs of summer population.</p>
        <p>While library staffs work from 9am to 9pm to make the library an “open door” for the community, availability cannot make up for the lack of a library's basic commodity: books.</p>

        <p>The borough will rent a room in the Frank Wildey building on Broad Street to house the library, and the rent will cost $500 for the remainder of this year. $1,800 to $2,000 will also be needed to get the library started.</p>
        <p>The library will have 3,000 books to circulate, will be open 3 days a week, and $500 of new books will be purchased.</p>

        <p>Monmouth County Library now has 125,000 books, and service partnerships with 5 elementary schools and 5 high schools. Individual branches in the county system are operated according to each branch's directors.</p>
        <p>Residents and property owners hgain library cards for free, and others can join into the system by paying a deposit that is returned to them when the paying member withdraws. Many summer residents take advantage of this deposit system, and those under 21 must get permission from a parent to join by deposit.</p>
        <p>For convenience, the Branch Manager Librarian at Allenhurst lets nearby communities that are part of the Monm outh County Library system - Loch Arbour, Wanamassa, Interlaken, and the southern part of Deal – use the Allenhurst facilities. The Library Director, Killian, states that they would like this type of inter-community borrowing to extend throughout the county system further: “I’d like to see people get a card good throughout the county”.</p>
        <p>The only county municipalities now that are not part of the system are Asbury Park, Avon, Bradley Beach, Freehold Borough, Keyport, Long Branch, Matawan, Matawan Township, Middletown Township, Red Bank, and Spring Lake. Most of these exempt communities have their own local library facilities instead.</p>
        <p>To be part of the Monmouth County Library system, a municipality must pass a resolution to join in, and the community will need to pay a library tax set by the Board of Freeholders - which the count library answers to. The library tax is based on the valuation of real property.</p>

        <p>26 public libraries now exist along the shore – 19 library in Monmouth County, and 7 in Ocean County. In both counties, library buildings exist mostly in larger municipalities, and bookmobile services service the more rural parts.</p>
        <p>One of Monmouth County's Bookmobiles serves about 70 schools, and the other Bookmobile is still devoted to visiting rural areas.</p>
        <p>Fair Haven, Ocean Towship, and Rumson are announcing that they may build new libraries, while Long Branch, Little Silver, Middletown Township, and Raritan Township are planning on making additions to their present library buildings.</p>
        <p>Director Killian also says that changing populations at the Shore has increased demands for better library facilities.</p>
        <p> The Director also says that the headquarters branch housed in the house on Broad Street in Freehold is becoming cramped again.</p>
